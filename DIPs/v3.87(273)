Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, download and install first. If you prefer to clone from the command line, see Clone a repository.

    You’ll see the clone button under the Source heading. Click that button.
    Now click Check out in SourceTree. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
    When you see the Clone New dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click Clone.
    Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree, or you can add, commit, and push from the command line.
